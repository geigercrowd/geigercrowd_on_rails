%h1= title 'API Documentation'
%p
  Because geigercrowd.net is designed as an open platform, we provide a API to query and update every data available.
  %br
  Currently we provide a REST-orientated JSON API.

%h1=link_to "Public API", '/api/public'
%p
  The public API can be used to get a list of every instrument and sample, it is intended for applications which want to either visualize data or merge it with it's own database.
  It also provides user-based data, useful to validate submitted samples.
  
%h1=link_to "Private API", '/api/private'
%p
  The private API is used to manage a users instruments and samples. It's main focus is to create and or update instruments and samples.


%h1 Consistent parameters
%p
  These parameters are required or supported by every API call.
%h2 Required
%ul
  %li!= "api_key - #{link_to 'Your API key', ''} for authentication and tracking"
%h2 Optional
%ul
  %li page - Require the next 50 entries (supported by every call which returns an array)

%h2 Example URIs
%p
  Click through to each URI to see the returned JSON.
%ul
  %li
    =link_to '/instruments.json', "#{root_url}instruments.json?api_key=#{api_key}"
